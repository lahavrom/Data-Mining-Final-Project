How well does the NBA 2K video game predict the players’ ratings?

**Problem description:**

NBA 2K is a series of basketball sports simulation video games developed and released annually since 1999. The premise of each game in the series is to emulate the sport of basketball, more specifically, the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the game, each player is given an overall ranking based on his abilities and performance in real life.
Each year, the NBA 2K game is published in proximity to the upcoming NBA season, for example: NBA 2K20 is published before the 2019-2020 season. Therefore, the 2k company is predicting the players’ overall rating based on each player’s performances, stats, ability, age and more, from the past year and how well will the player perform in the upcoming year.
The parameters we want to examine in this project are:
1.	How well does the game predict players' success?
2.	Could we characterize players that the game predicts better / worse?
3.	Did the prediction get more accurate over the years or did it decline?
